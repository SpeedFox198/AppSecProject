<b> Project Name: </b> Bras Basah Books <br />
<b> Proposed Industry:</b> Bras Basah Complex Bookstore Website <br />
<b> Project Description: </b> <br />

Bras Basah complex is located at 231 Bain Street, 180231. 
Bras Basah Complex is known as City of Books, a mall that is well known for its huge collection of bookstores. Since the 1980s, this place has allowed many book merchants to come together to make book sales. It has since become a cultural heritage for arts and cultures. 
Bras Basah Complex has a lot of bookstores. However, not all bookstores have an online presence themselves due to Covid-19. 

Under this circumstance, We as creative, enthusiastic and innovative programmers do not want to see the city of books die down and become a figment left behind in Singapore history books. Therefore we have decided to help store owners transition digitally in this Covid-19 affected world as well as create solutions that meet the needs of the business as well as the customers patronising these shop owners' stores.
